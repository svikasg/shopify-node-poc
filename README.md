When creating labels for orders, ShipStation will use the Ship From Location that was defined on the order record. The Create Label for Order endpoint does not support a custom Ship From Location because that would require modifying the order record, which the Create Label for Order is not capable of doing. If you need to update the Ship From Location associated with an order, you can do so by making an Update Order (https://www.shipstation.com/docs/api/orders/create-update-order/) request with the Warehouse ID (https://www.shipstation.com/docs/api/warehouses/get/) associated with the Ship From Location they want to use. The Create Shipment Label does not rely on a pre-existing order record, so it offers more flexibility.
